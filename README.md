    1. Efficient Data Storage
    2. Fast Data Retrieval
    3. Efficient Data Management
    4. Data Sharing
    5. Data Analysis
  - Types of Databases:
    - RDBMS (Relational Database Management System)

  - *Data Definition:* CREATE DATABASE, ALTER DATABASE, CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE, DROP TABLE
  - *Data Optimization:* CREATE INDEX,Â DROPÂ INDEX
- *Detailed Focus on SELECT:*
  - Mastered theÂ SELECTÂ statement for retrieving data

  - PracticedÂ COUNT(DISTINCT column)Â to count unique entries
### Day 3: SQL Filtering & Sorting
*Date:* 15-10-2025
- *WHERE Clause Mastery:*
  - Comparison operators: =, >, <, >=, <=, <>
  - Special operators: BETWEEN, LIKE, IN
  - Text vs Numeric field filtering
- *ORDER BY Keyword:*
  - ASC/DESC sorting
  - Alphabetical ordering
  - Multiple column sorting
  - Combined WHERE and ORDER BY queries
### Day 4: SQL Logical Operators
*Date:* 16-10-2025
  - *AND Operator:* Requiring all conditions to be TRUE
  - *OR Operator:* Requiring at least one condition to be TRUE
  - *Combining AND & OR:* Using parentheses for complex logic
  - *NOT Operator:* Excluding data by negating conditions
    - NOT LIKE, NOT BETWEEN, NOT IN
    - NOT with comparison operators
  - *Complex Query Building:* Creating multi-condition logical statements
### Day 5: INSERT Statements & NULL Values
*Date:* 17-10-2025
- *INSERT INTO Statements:*
  - Inserting complete rows
  - Inserting data into specific columns only
  - Inserting multiple rows efficiently
- *NULL Values:*
  - Understanding NULL as "unknown" or "missing"
  - Testing for NULL with IS NULL operator
  - Testing for non-NULL with IS NOT NULL operator
  - Why = NULL and <> NULL don't work
### Day 6: UPDATE & DELETE Statements
*Date:* 18-10-2025
- *UPDATE Statement:*
  - Modifying existing records in a table
  - Updating single and multiple columns
  - Using WHERE clause to target specific records
